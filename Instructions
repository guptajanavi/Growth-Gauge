Hi, my name is Janavi Gupta and I study at Hiranandani Foundation School, Powai. 
Growth Gauge is a project that is close to my heart as it involves two things that I am very passionate about, namely, computer science and abolishing the taboos of menstruation.

You can find the dataset for this project here: https://www.kaggle.com/guptajanavi/palpebral-conjunctiva-to-detect-anaemia
Please download it and name it as MalnutritionImages.
Then, separate the anaemic and non-anaemic images labelled as 1 and 2 respectively into separate folders called Anaemic and Non-Anaemic.
You will also find the .h5 obtained from the Keras Model there

You can run the code in the following order:
1. Create Dataset
2. trainModel/ Keras Sequential Model
3. testingModel/ testingKerasSequentialModel.py
4. enterUserInformation
5. generateGraph
6. generateResult
